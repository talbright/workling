#
#  Run the job over the spawn plugin. Refer to the README for instructions on 
#  installing Spawn. 
#
#  Spawn forks the entire process once for each job. This means that the job starts 
#  with a very low latency, but takes up more memory for each job. 
# 
#  It's also possible to configure Spawn to start a Thread for each job. Do this
#  by setting
#
#      Workling::Clients::SpawnClient.options = { :method => :thread }
#
#  Have a look at the Spawn README to find out more about the characteristics of this.
