#
#  An SQS client

# Requires the following configuration in workling.yml:
#
# production:
#   sqs_options:
#     aws_access_key_id: <your AWS access key id>
#     aws_secret_access_key: <your AWS secret access key>
#
# You can also add the following optional parameters:
#
#     # Queue names consist of an optional prefix, followed by the environment
#     # and the name of the key.
#     prefix: foo_
#
#     # The number of SQS messages to retrieve at once. The maximum and default
#     # value is 10.
#     messages_per_req: 5
#
#     # The SQS visibility timeout for retrieved messages. Defaults to 30 seconds.
#     visibility_timeout: 15
